== Introduction

- Agents in Powergrid use DRL algorithms
- Network's architecture has big impact on performance

#v(5%)
#highlight()[Problem:]
- Network architecture is currently done by hand
  - Knowledge needed
  - Standard architecture not optimised

#v(10%)
#highlight()[#sym.arrow.r.filled Idea:] \
Neural Architecture Search (NAS) algorithms may find an architecture \
with better performance in a reasonable time.
