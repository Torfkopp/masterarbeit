== Summary

- Hypothesis: a NAS algorithm can perform better than manually picked architectures in a reasonable time in the ARL architecture
- Three NAS algorithms were tested:
    - NEAT (Evolutionary Algorithm)
    - An reinforcement learning approach ("Minimal-NAS")
    - Bayesian optimisation

- 1#super[st] experiment showed BO performing better, but may not be meaningful since no agent learned
- 2#super[nd] experiment showed no NAS method performing, with Baseline only one learning

#sym.arrow.r.filled Hypothesis could not be proven, further research needed
