    - All 3 NAS and baseline were tested

    - ARL Defender Objective
    - 3 episodes Ã  100 days simulated
    - step size of 900

== Evaluation

- Contrary results: 1#super[st] experiment agrees to hypothesis, 2#super[nd] does not

- In both experiments, the NAS methods do not learn
  - Baseline also does not learn in 1#super[st] experiment \ #sym.arrow.r.filled Experiment might not work as intended
  - Either implementation of NAS methods is not correct or \ the task is not suitable for NAS methods \ #sym.arrow.r.filled More research needed

- NEAT had a problem in the 2#super[nd] experiment when fitted all actuators
  - Stopped after first step; due to the unique network structure in NEAT's impl.
  - Fewer actuators were used, hence the significantly worse performance
