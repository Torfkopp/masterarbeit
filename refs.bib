abstract = {Topology and Weight Evolving Artificial Neural Network (TWEANN) is a concept to find the topology and weights of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) using genetic algorithms. However, a well-known downside is that TWEANN algorithms often evolve inefficient large ANNs for large-scale problems and require long runtimes.To address this issue, we propose a new TWEANN algorithm called Artificial Life Form (ALF) with the following technical advancements: (1) speciation via structural and semantic similarity to form better candidate solutions, (2) dynamic adaptation of the observed candidate solutions for better convergence properties, and (3) integration of solution quality into genetic reproduction to increase the probability of optimization success. Experiments on large-scale problems confirm that these approaches allow effective solving of these problems and lead to efficient evolved ANNs.},

abstract = {Reinforcement learning (RL) is a machine learning approach that trains agents to maximize cumulative rewards through interactions with environments. The integration of RL with deep learning has recently resulted in impressive achievements in a wide range of challenging tasks, including board games, arcade games, and robot control. Despite these successes, several critical challenges remain, such as brittle convergence properties caused by sensitive hyperparameters, difficulties in temporal credit assignment with long time horizons and sparse rewards, a lack of diverse exploration, particularly in continuous search space scenarios, challenges in credit assignment in multi-agent RL, and conflicting objectives for rewards. Evolutionary computation (EC), which maintains a population of learning agents, has demonstrated promising performance in addressing these limitations. This article presents a comprehensive survey of state-of-the-art methods for integrating EC into RL, referred to as evolutionary reinforcement learning (EvoRL). We categorize EvoRL methods according to key research areas in RL, including hyperparameter optimization, policy search, exploration, reward shaping, meta-RL, and multi-objective RL. We then discuss future research directions in terms of efficient methods, benchmarks, and scalable platforms. This survey serves as a resource for researchers and practitioners interested in the field of EvoRL, highlighting the important challenges and opportunities for future research. With the help of this survey, researchers and practitioners can develop more efficient methods and tailored benchmarks for EvoRL, further advancing this promising cross-disciplinary research field.}

abstract = {Deep neuroevolution and deep Reinforcement Learning have received a lot of attention over the past few years. Some works have compared them, highlighting their pros and cons, but an emerging trend combines them so as to benefit from the best of both worlds. In this article, we provide a survey of this emerging trend by organizing the literature into related groups of works and casting all the existing combinations in each group into a generic framework. We systematically cover all easily available papers irrespective of their publication status, focusing on the combination mechanisms rather than on the experimental results. In total, we cover 45 algorithms more recent than 2017. We hope this effort will favor the growth of the domain by facilitating the understanding of the relationships between the methods, leading to deeper analyses, outlining missing useful comparisons and suggesting new combinations of mechanisms.},
