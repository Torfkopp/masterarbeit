== Machine Learning <machine_learning>

As shown in @ai_venn, Machine learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) and it focuses on developing algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to perform tasks without explicit instructions. Instead, these systems learn from data by identifying patterns, making decisions, and improving over time through experience. This capability to learn and adapt autonomously has made machine learning a pivotal technology in various fields, from healthcare and finance to transportation and entertainment.

Machine learning is broadly defined as the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience. Tom M. Mitchell, a prominent figure in the field, provides a more formal definition: "A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E" (Mitchell, 1997). This definition highlights three key elements: the task (T), the experience (E), and the performance measure (P). @mitchell1997machine

Machine learning encompasses several types of learning paradigms, each suited to different types of problems and data: @goodfellow2016deep

- Supervised Learning: In supervised learning, the algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset, which means that each training example is paired with an output label. The goal is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs that can be used to predict the labels of new, unseen data. Common supervised learning algorithms include linear regression, decision trees, and neural networks.

- Unsupervised Learning: Unsupervised learning deals with unlabeled data. The algorithm's goal is to identify underlying patterns or structures in the data without any specific guidance. Techniques such as clustering (e.g. k-means) and dimensionality reduction (e.g. principal component analysis) are typical examples of unsupervised learning.

- Semi-supervised Learning: This approach combines both labeled and unlabeled data to improve learning accuracy. It is particularly useful when labeling data is expensive or time-consuming.

- Reinforcement Learning: In reinforcement learning, an agent interacts with an environment and learns to make decisions by receiving rewards or penalties. The agent's objective is to maximise cumulative rewards over time. This paradigm is often applied in robotics, game playing, and autonomous systems.

Machine learning's ability to analyse vast amounts of data and extract meaningful insights has revolutionised many industries. In healthcare, ML algorithms can predict disease outbreaks, diagnose medical conditions from imaging data, and personalise treatment plans. In finance, they are used for credit scoring, fraud detection, and algorithmic trading. Autonomous vehicles rely on machine learning for navigation, obstacle detection, and decision-making. Additionally, ML powers recommendation systems for online shopping and content streaming platforms, enhancing user experiences by suggesting products and media based on individual preferences. @mitchell1997machine
