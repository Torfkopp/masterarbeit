Adversarial reinforcement learning is an extension of traditional reinforcement learning techniques applied to multi-agent, competitive environments.
In adversial reinforcement learning, at least two agents interact in an environment with opposing goals, often competing in a zero-sum game where one agent's gain is the other's loss. Both agents (or all agents respectively) learn and adapt their strategies simultaneously as they interact with each other and the environment.
By learning the estimate of the value of state-action pairs, the agents may consider the opponent's potential moves. 
The agents must balance exploration of new strategies and exploitation of known effective actions to achieve their goals.

// Key aspects of adversarial reinforcement learning include:
//   1. Multiple agents: At least two agents interact in the environment, typically with opposing goals1
//   2. Competitive setting: Agents compete against each other, often in a zero-sum game where one agent's gain is the other's loss1
//   3. Simultaneous learning: Both agents learn and adapt their strategies as they interact with each other and the environment1
//   4. State-action value estimation: Agents learn to estimate the value of state-action pairs, considering the opponent's potential moves1
//   5. Exploration-exploitation trade-off: Agents must balance exploring new strategies and exploiting known effective actions1

// Challenges in Adversarial Reinforcement Learning

//   1. Non-stationary environment: As opponents learn and adapt, the environment becomes dynamic, requiring continuous adaptation1
//   2. Opponent modeling: Some approaches attempt to model the opponent's strategy to improve decision-making1
//   3. Generalization: Algorithms must generalize learned knowledge across similar states to handle large state spaces efficiently1
//   4. Continuous state spaces: Many real-world adversarial scenarios involve continuous state information, requiring specialized techniques1
