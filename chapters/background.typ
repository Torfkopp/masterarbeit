= Background

The implementation and results of this thesis rely on an understanding of machine learning and the environment in which the thesis's study takes place.
Thus, this chapter outlines the basics of Agents, Machine Learning (Deep Reinforcement Learning and Evolutionary Algorithms), and ways to optimise ML.
